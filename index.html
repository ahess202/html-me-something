                        <br>
                            <p>My experiences with food when I was young was really only trying new things. My mom is very picky when it comes to food, but my dad was always very adventurous. He loved going to different restaurants to try all kinds of cuisines, but he never really cooked himself. I never really had the opportunity or guidance when it came to real cooking when I was young, just the basics. I didn't really discover this passion until I got my first job.</p>

                    <h1>My First Job</h1>
                    <p>I started my first real job during my senior year of high school. I got hired as a dishwasher in the kitchen of a local hospital, Holy Redeemer.</p>

                    <p>Up until this point, I had barely any experience or intrest in cooking. After a few months of becoming more flexible and filling more roles, the head chef had asked if I wanted to start helping out on the line.</p>

                    <h1>Later Jobs And My Growing Passion</h1>
                    <p>I started to fill every single role in the cook position after a while, being taught by the different cooks, as well as the Head and Sous Chef, on the various stations. I learned how to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prep just about everything we worked with, and on occasion, foods we did not normally work with.</li>
                            <li>Work the sides station alongside the main cook; learning how to plate properly, as well as develop speed</li>
                            <li>Fill the role of main cook; actually cooking the food, and practice managing the tickets effeciently</li>
                            <li>Prep the soups, giving me practice making food in large batches and manage ingredient ratios properly</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>All of these experiences helped me realize how much I enjoyed cooking, and introduced me to a new passion I never knew I'd ever have. At the time I was going to college to earn a degree in computer science, as I had a passion for computers and technology all my life. I still knew I wanted to pursue a career in CS, but I was definitely starting to consider a job in the restaraunt industry.

                    After about 4 years I left Holy Redeemer, and started jumping to different jobs, focusing on my two different passions. I got a job at a local restaurant, and worked as a line cook/expediter for about a year, but it was turned out to be a less positive ecxperience than Holy Redeemer. There was surpisingly much less comradarie on the line, and it was a much higher stress environment.

                    After almost a year there, I decided to re-focus on my career in technology, and got a job a Best Buy selling computers. I enjoyed working with computers, but I learned that I hated sales. I'm not very good at it to be honest. After only about 6 months with Best Buy, I had gotten a job with Comcast as a field technician. I loved my work, and was happy continuing my career in technology, but when I started this job full-time, I paused finishing my CS degree.</p>

                    <h1>Cooking As A Hobby</h1>
                    <p>Cooking started to just become something I did at home; just making my every day meals. But as I started to do it more, I realized it was much more enjoyable to do at home for a number of reasons.</p>

                    <h1>My Hobby Now</h1>
                    <p>Cooking is still a passion for me even, especially as a hobby. I'm learning to find ways to really enjoy what I do, whether it be work, or one of my many other hobbies. Cooking has become an essential part of my life, because I can use it to really enjoy or express myself, share in different cultures from my own, and just de-stress. I think we should all try to find activites that can fill as many roles in our lives as cooking has done for me.</p>
